Simple Chat Application
This is a simple chat application designed with an object-oriented programming (OOP) structure. It does not implement web sockets or real-time messaging protocols. Instead, it handles chat functionalities using threads and a connection to a PostgreSQL database to manage chat data.

Features
Multi-threading support: Handles multiple clients or chat sessions concurrently using Java threads.
OOP Design: The application follows an object-oriented design for better maintainability and modularity.
PostgreSQL Integration: Connects to a PostgreSQL database for storing and managing user data, messages, and other chat-related information.
